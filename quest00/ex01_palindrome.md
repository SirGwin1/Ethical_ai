Exercise 1: The Palindrome Challenge

Step 1 - Do it yourself
Ans:
def palindrome_checker(s):
    #reversing a string to convert it to a palindrome
    return s == s[::-1]
    
#test_cases
print(palindrome_checker("racecar"))
print(palindrome_checker("hello"))
print(palindrome_checker("A man a plan a canal Panama"))

Step 2 - Use AI to learn
Ans:
"I wrote a palindrome function. Here's my code:
[
 def palindrome_checker(s):
    #reversing string to convert it to a palindrome
    return s == s[::-1]
    
#test_cases
print(palindrome_checker("racecar"))
print(palindrome_checker("hello"))
print(palindrome_checker("A man a plan a canal Panama"))   
]

What's the time complexity?
Ans:
the time complexity for the algorithm above is a linear time with an o(n) notation

What edge cases might I miss?
Ans:
probably an edge case that might have a better computational time to my approach


Are there better approaches?"
Ans:
Yes, there are better approaches to solving this exercise. i'm considering the use of for loops to achieve same result

Step 3 - Reflection
1. What did you learn from solving it before asking AI?
Ans:
from solving the palindrome exercise, I learned how to break tasks into smaller task and then try to logically solve it with some programing concepts at my disposal.

2. How is your understanding different now?
Ans:
from solving the palindrome exercise, I have been able to understand certain basics about;functions, operators, data types, indexing and time complexity.

3. Could you now write similar functions (e.g., reverse a string) without help?
Ans:
yes I can.
