currently, there are so many programing concepts that i'm yet to be abreast with; concepts like functions, objects and classes, to this end, AI is my sure bet for the explanation of these concepts. in the future I intend to be a developer that utilizes Ai for just efficiency and finetunning, rather than a get go for explanation of programing concepts.s
