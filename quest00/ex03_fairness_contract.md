#I will use AI when:

    I have tried solving a problem myself.

    I need to understand why something works.

    I want to explore alternative approaches.

#I will NOT use AI when:

    I haven't tried the problem on my own.

    I am completing an exam or assessment.

    I am still learning fundamental concepts.

#I know I'm using AI fairly when:

    I can explain my code without AI's help.

    I could solve a similar problem independently.

    I feel more confident in my own understanding.
