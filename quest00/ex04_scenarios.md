1. Interview: You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems?

Ans: if one has always relied on AI to design a system and one was asked to explain a caching system design, it becomes a tedious venture, since an one requires an indebt understanding of the front,back end functionality and certain interactions to be able to give perspective to the working principle of the sytem. Hence, for an effective use of Ai in system design, one needs a review and testing of  the output

2. Production Bug: At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?

Ans: with the base knowledge of the bug to be fixed, I can fix it even in senario when AI is offline

3.     New Technology: A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?

Ans: Every technology  comes with a documentation, so even though AI hasnt been trained oonn it yet, I will learn from the documentation of the new technology

Reflection: Write one paragraph explaining how using AI fairly today prepares you for real-world challenges like these.

Ai is such a powerful tool in modern day software development, since it can help in many aspect of software development like code review and scalability. However, over dependence on Ai like the replacement of thinking by the developer is where the ills are.
