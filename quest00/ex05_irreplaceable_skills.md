Objective: Identify the human skills that separate good coders from AI users.

Rate yourself (1–5) in each skill and plan improvements:

Choose your lowest-rated skill and write 3 specific actions you'll take this week to improve it without relying on AI

the 3 action plans for my most rated skill; knowing when code is wrong or inefficient include:
a. I will study python documentations more this week so as to graps more on its syntax.
b. I will spend more hours this week practicing some core concepts like Data structures, functions, loops and conditional statements.
b. I will try building some basic projects this week using the python language to see my overall understanding of what works and what doesn't.
