1. A short summary of what you learned about AI and self-reliance.

the ineffective use of Ai by a developer is a loop a modern day developer  ought to overcome in a bid to become irreplaceable by Ai in this fast changing environment. Ai can already code in most cases, so as a developer its therefore imperative to build more irreplaceabble skills like; sytem thinking, strong understanding of what we build and biases that are from critical and deep thinking. once there's an overdependence on Ai it becomes very dificult to build a strong personnal analytical skills by a developer. 
2. Your main insight about using AI ethically as a coder.

From the exercises on ethical-ai, I was able to understand that Ai could be utilized both in the right and wrong way, Ai is a tool to help software developers in their journey but not a tool to replace actual thinking that ought to be done by the developer.

3. One paragraph describing how you plan to apply these principles in future quests.

In my subsequent quest, I intend to use AI only for explanation of certain concept, only after I have carried out very deep critical thinking. I will craft my algorithm by my self and will only use Ai strictly for learning and not for problem solving.
